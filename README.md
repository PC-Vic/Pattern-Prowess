## Introduction
Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing. In this tutorial, we will dissect a regex pattern that validates email addresses, providing a comprehensive understanding of its components.

## Regex Pattern
The selected regex pattern for this tutorial is:


/^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}$/

This regex pattern is designed to validate email addresses, ensuring they follow a basic structure.

## Topics Covered
This tutorial covers a wide range of important regex concepts, including:

- **Anchors:** Explains the `^` and `$` anchors and their role in regex.
- **Quantifiers and Operators:** Covers the `+` quantifier and its use for matching one or more characters.
- **Character Classes:** Discusses the use of character classes like `[A-Za-z0-9]` to match specific sets of characters.
- **Grouping and Capturing:** Shows how to use parentheses for grouping and capturing portions of a pattern.
- **Bracket Expressions:** Demonstrates how bracket expressions like `[.-]` work to match specific characters.
- **Greedy and Lazy Matching:** Explains the concepts of greedy and lazy matching and when to use them.
- **Boundaries:** Discusses the importance of using `^` and `$` to ensure matching occurs at the start and end of the string.
- **Back-References:** Introduces the concept of back-references for matching repeated patterns.
- **Look-Ahead and Look-Behind:** Explains look-ahead and look-behind assertions for more complex matching.

## How It Works
The tutorial breaks down each component of the regex pattern, explaining its purpose and how it contributes to the validation of email addresses. 

## Usage
