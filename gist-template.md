## Regex Components

### Anchors

In order to define where a match should appear within a string, we utilize anchors. In our email regex "vic123@email.com," the '^' anchor matches the start of the string, ensuring that the email address starts from the beginning. 

example: /^vic123@email\.com/

The email must come right after the match, which is ensured by the anchor, which places it at the beginning of the string.
