# Pattern Prowess (a guide to help you understand regular expressions)

Email addresses can be quite diverse, and it's essential to validate them accurately. In this tutorial, we will explore a regular expression pattern for validating email addresses. This regex pattern is designed to match a wide range of valid email addresses and is a good starting point for email validation in your projects.

## Regex Pattern:

/^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

In regular expressions, anchors are special characters used to specify the position of a match within a string. They ensure that the pattern matches at specific positions in the string. For our email address validation regex pattern, the following anchors are utilized:

example: /^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}$/

In this pattern, the ^ anchor asserts the start of the string. It indicates that the match must begin from the beginning of the input string. In the context of email validation, this ensures that the email address is matched from the very start, and no characters are allowed before it.

Also note, the $ anchor asserts the end of the string. Notice that the end of the regex above ends with the $ character. It signifies that the match must conclude at the end of the input string. In the case of email validation, this ensures that no characters are allowed after the email address, and it must be the last portion of the string.

### Quantifiers

In regular expressions, quantifiers are used to specify how many times a character or group of characters should be repeated in the input string. In our email address validation regex pattern, we use them as follows:

/^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}$/

In this pattern, the + quantifier is used after character classes like [A-Za-z0-9._%+-] and [A-Za-z0-9.-]. It means that one or more of these characters can occur in the input string. This allows for flexibility in the local and domain parts of the email address, permitting different valid characters to be used.

* - The "Zero or More" Quantifier

/^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]*@[A-Za-z0-9.-]*\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}$/

In some variations of email addresses, it's possible for parts of the email address to be empty, such as in "user@domain.com." The * quantifier allows for zero or more occurrences of the preceding character class, which means that these parts can be empty or have any number of valid characters.

### OR Operator

In regular expressions, the OR operator is represented by the pipe symbol '|' which allows you to specify alternative patterns. It means that the regex can match either the pattern on the left side of the | or the pattern on the right side. In the email regex "vic123@email.com," we don't have an OR operator. The entire regex represents a fixed, exact pattern that must be matched.

example: vic123@email\.com

In this pattern, there are no OR operators, which means that the email address must match the characters "vic123@email.com" exactly. The absence of an OR operator makes this regex very strict, ensuring that only this specific email address is matched.
